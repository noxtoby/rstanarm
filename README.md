# Latent Time Joint Mixed Effect Models (LTJMM)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mcdonoue/rstanarm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mcdonoue/rstanarm)[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/rstanarm?color=blue)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rstanarm)[![Downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/rstanarm?color=blue)](http://cran.rstudio.com/package=rstanarm)

### Latent Time Joint Mixed Effect Models (LTJMM) via rstanarm

This fork of the [rstanarm](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstanarm) package includes the following modifications:

1. **stan_mvmer** models are extended from 5 to 20 longitudinal submodels
2. **stan_ljtmm** extends **stan_mvmer** to accommodate a group-specific (individual-specific) latent time parameters which are shared within group across submodels.

The LTJMM is described in [Li, et al. (2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0962280217737566).

### Installation

To install from GitHub, first make sure that you can install the **rstan**
package and C++ toolchain by following these
[instructions](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).
Once **rstan** is successfully installed, you can install **rstanarm** from
GitHub using the **devtools** package by executing the following in R:

```r
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("mcdonohue/rstanarm", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```
